/*  LED-Brightness-Template
*   This template code is configure to work with a RGB LED. Three PwmOut objects are created to control the red, green and blue colours.
*   The program cycles through two colours (red and green) in turn, ramping the brightness by incrmenting the duty cycle by 2% per loop iteration.
*   
*   The code should be modified in accordance with ADC & PWM Activity 2.
